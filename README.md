# Download

You could download our builds from https://openvision.tech/stb-images/
* How to use sdcard images (E.g. raspberrypi):

You could use https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/ or similar tools to write the image on a sdcard.

# Support

Please use our forum at https://forum.openvision.tech or our issue page at https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/openvision-oe/issues

# Distribution

* Are you allowed to compile development versions? Yes!
* Are you allowed to distribute development versions? Yes but only with "unofficial-version" tag.
* Are you allowed to make our images compatible with clones? Yes!
* Are you allowed to distribute cloned images? Yes but only with "clone-version" tag.
* Do we support clones? No!
* Are you allowed to make backup of our images? Yes!
* Are you allowed to distribute backup images? Yes but only with "backup-version" tag.
* Do we provide support for self-building? No! We prefer to work on our projects.
* Do we need more Vision Developers? Absolutely yes! Contribute to our git and we will contact you!
* Do we need more Vision Testers? Absolutely yes! Test our images and report bugs, help us grow you'll see the title flows.
* Do we support our image in multiboot situations? No! Check about screen and if our module is not loaded then you're on your own!

If you see your model in https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/openvision-oe/blob/develop/Vision-metas.md it means there will be Open Vision for it otherwise read https://forum.openvision.tech/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=30 and don't spam the board!

# Compile

You could compile Open Vision for so many brands/models:
* Vision-metas: https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/openvision-oe/blob/develop/Vision-metas.md

# How to build an Open Vision image

1. Clone openpli-oe-core somewhere:
```
git clone -b develop --depth 1 https://github.com/OpenPLi/openpli-oe-core.git
```
2. Enter the openpli-oe-core directory:
```
cd openpli-oe-core
```
3. Clone openvision-oe:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OpenVisionE2/openvision-oe.git
```
4. Run our image.sh script (Do not run bitbake or any related script as root!):
```
cd openvision-oe
./image.sh
```
If you want to compile an image for only 1 machine just choose "Specific".

If you want to go clean again, do not remove your "sources" directoy! Never!

If you answered something wrong don't worry, just remove "user.ovstep"!

# Hints for multiple architectures

* Removing the "build" directory solves most of the errors. For a fast remove use "rm -rf build".
(If you just want to reduce the build size use "cleanup.sh".)
* If you want to compile images for old machines like dm800/cube/su980, first build for them.
* If you want to compile images for x64 machines like alienx/kxpx series, first build for them.
* If you want to compile images for 4K machines with ARM architecture and you get error each time, try compile for a Mipsel machine like dm7020hd first then compile your ARM images.
